    	<h2>do you ship worldwide?</h2> 
	<p>no. currently, we only ship to south america.</p>

	<h2>how does the return and refund works?</h2>
	<p>in case of malfunctioning or regrets, you have 7 days (starting by the day you received the product), to return it and have your money back.</p>

	<h2>how long does it take to my product arrive?</h2>
	<p>we build by demand, so, the building process only starts once someone buy the product, since we have a small team, the building takes some time, but we expect that within 1 month your product is already with you.</p>

	<h2>why should i buy your products?</h2>
	<p>that's up to you to decide.</p>
	<p>take a look at our website, philosophy and products and come to your conclusions!</p>
