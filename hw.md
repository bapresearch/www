#hello world!

We are **bap research** (yes, all lowercase), we are not a company, a big corporation, an organization, etc. We would say we are more like a group of friends, there's no boss, CEO, president, none of this bullshit, we make decisions talking to each other and getting into a conscent. We hate autoritarism, so, we don't apply it here.

**bap research** was created to bring together people with common interests in the same place and work into all kinds of tech fields, e.g. crypto, AI, cybersec, etc. Everybody here has its own specialty, so, we work together and end up doing a lot of cool stuff.

Anyways, if you'd like to follow what we are currently working on, you can check our social media:

<a href="https://github.com/bapresearch" target="_blank">github</a><br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/bapresearch" target="_blank">twitter</a><br/>
<a href="https://instagram.com/bapresearch" target="_blank">instagram</a><br/>

Currently, we are not hiring, but everything here is made in a remote way and with flexible work hours, once we start hiring again, a section called *jobs* will appear on our homepage, so if you are interested in working with us, you will just have to click on the link and apply for one of our open positions.

At the moment we are writing this, the COVID-19 pandemic is happening, so please, if you are reading this and can stay at home. **Stay at home.**

\- See you later, bap research.
